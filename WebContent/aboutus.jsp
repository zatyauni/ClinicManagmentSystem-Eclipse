Tanglin Health Clinic was built before independence around the 1890s. 
First known as Tanglin Hospital, one of the earliest hospitals in Malaya. 
Now this hospital is 130 years old, and has now been turned into a health clinic. 
This clinic is a paperless clinic and uses the Teleprimary Care system completely. 
This clinic is located near Taman Tasik Perdana or now known as Kuala Lumpur Botanical Garden and Bukit Aman Headquarters.
The administration of the clinic is under the Lembah Pantai Health Office (PKLP). 
The clinic receives around 500-600 clients a day and provides outpatient treatment services, 
health promotion & prevention and ongoing disease control to the residents around the operating area.
